# generator-jb-module

An simple yeoman generator for building NodeJS libraries and console apps with TypeScript.

## Features:
 - Easily build, test, and publish to NPM via predefined gulp tasks.
 - Tests written with AVA, but can be swapped out with your framework of choice.
 - Use TypeScript for type safety, improved intellisense, and ES7+ language features.

## Tips
 - Once installed, run `gulp help` to see the available commands.
 - Currently all of the settings default to my usual choices. Make an issue/PR to change them and we can make it happen!
